## 🎯 About  
Hi! I’m **Varun Prakash Kadam**, a software engineer passionate about building clean, modern web experiences.  
This is my personal portfolio website — a place where I showcase my skills, projects, blog posts, and contact information.  
Built with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS (or the stack you used), it’s designed to be fast, responsive and user-friendly.

## 🛠 Stack & Key Features  
- **Next.js** + **TypeScript** — full-stack React with static export / server rendering.  
- **Tailwind CSS** or **(CSS / Styled-Components)** — utility-first styling for rapid UI development.  
- Responsive design — works well on mobile, tablet and desktop.  
- Dark mode support (if you included).  
- Clean code structure:  
  - `app/` (or `pages/`) for routes  
  - `components/` for reusable UI pieces  
  - `styles/` for global CSS / config  
- Perfect for showcasing projects, experience, blog posts, and contact form.
